This was my first time using Fusion, KiCad, or GitHub so if its not good please understand. It was fun espexcially using KiCad do design and wire the PCB.
This is something i want to do in my future so it helps to have a website like this to give a first intruduction
Here is my updated circuit diagramm... now with a rotary encoder ment for controlling volume

Challanges:
not knowing how to code, or having used any CAD or design tools before was tough.
didnt help.
but the tutorial was straight foreward enough.
i hope i did the freestyle parts (3d modles in the cad and wireing) right
this was my first time designing anything and it like to get feedback.
